		<h3>Highlighted Restaurants</h3>
		<p>The highlight restaurant is a restaurant that has a uniqueness to itself and continues to push itself into the food scene either as
		an up and coming or a seasoned restaurant that deserves to be featured. We hope to allow less informed people of the multitude of food
		scenes that they can hopefully get to experience and decide for themselves if it is getting the recognition it deserves.</p>
